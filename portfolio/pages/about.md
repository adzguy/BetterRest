# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I completed my graduation in Computer Science on December in year 2017. I worked in a startup company as a Web Developer. I designed a web interface and site graphics and determined client needs for company site. Currently I am developing my iOS Development skills with the new frameworks like SwiftUI. I have interests in Machine Learning studies and statistical models that my iOS applications use to perform tasks. Also, I am wanting to dive in to AI's different aspects in the future. Thanks for being in my page!
